Those who have been forced to endure the grotesque joke that is Southern Cross Station will no doubt shudder at its mere mention.

Despite being one of the busiest train stations in the entire city of Melbourne, it is also arguably the worst. Its many issues include:

  * Random poles in front of lifts and walkways
  * 100 year old wooden sleepers that are more rotten than Peter Dutton&#8217;s soul
  * Several too many vending machines
  * A roof that [leaks](https://www.flickr.com/photos/danielbowen/4478296769/) and/or [breaks](https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/icelands-eyjafjallajokull-delays-repairs-to-southern-cross-roof-20100518-vb9d.html) during rain
  * World’s slowest lifts
  * Lifts that can only fit one bicycle at a time
  * Lifts that smell perpetually of urine
  * Did I mention that the lifts are crap?
  * [No bins](https://twitter.com/metrotrains/status/836468017944920067)
  * CCTV cameras that can be turned off at a publicly accessible switch
  * Random fences between tracks for no reason and with huge gaps in them
  * Free [carbon monoxide poisoning](https://www.couriermail.com.au/travel/travel-news/diesel-headaches-at-southern-cross/news-story/3395140013f4f8cc9640ad5eeef812e8?sv=4f8e1a3ffbb9c4f42a0d4ff51badf6f9&nk=9e0f5907dfc769935693726a745a335c-1587981048) because the architects apparently didn&#8217;t understand that diesel trains need ventilation
  * Long walking distances from suburban to regional trains
  * No platform staff
  * Spencer Street Subway is closed [because reasons](https://www.danielbowen.com/2016/02/25/subway-into-socross/)
  * You can&#8217;t see information screens on platforms from the escalators
  * V/Line trains depart from completely random platforms
  * Bus terminal is a grey dungeon
  * Escalators [break](https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/broken-escalator-adds-to-southern-cross-chaos-20190412-p51die.html) [frequently](https://wongm.com/2018/02/failed-escalator-southern-cross-station/) and take months to fix ([just in time for them to break again](https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/now-it-s-running-now-it-s-not-another-hiccup-for-notorious-southern-cross-station-escalator-20190516-p51nvk.html))
  * Information screens break frequently and can’t handle temperatures of above 30 degrees
  * No toilets accessible from suburban platforms
  * Interchanging between platforms is annoying
  * Food court is strangely mediocre
  * Escalators go in the wrong directions in peak hour
  * Massive advertising boards block platform access
  * Platforms are too small (even the Government [admits](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-05/southern-cross-station-struggling-with-commuter-numbers-revamp/7904358) [this](https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/crowd-crush-at-southern-cross-but-station-revamp-faces-long-delays-20190318-p51557.html))

Despite these brief bursts of clear thought, the station overall has a four star rating out of five; a fact that will forever confound planners everywhere.

So if you&#8217;re after some breathing difficulties, tripping hazards and places to bang your head against a wall, why not pay a visit to this glorious monument to style over substance??
