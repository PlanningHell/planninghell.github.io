What is most hilarious is when real estate agents, developers and other equally unqualified people attempt a foray into the world of urban planning. Needless to say, it never ends well.

This time, Domain have [come out once again](https://web.archive.org/web/20191203104041/https://www.domain.com.au/liveable-melbourne/melbournes-most-liveable-suburbs-2019/melbournes-307-suburbs-ranked-for-liveability-2019-898676/) with their bi-yearly brain fart unironically titled &#8220;_Domain Liveable Melbourne_&#8220;_._

Some particular highlights include:

  * Fitzroy North and Carlton North losing points due to &#8220;topographic variation&#8221;
  * The description for Travencore begins with &#8220;You might not know it by name, but even most visitors to Melbourne have travelled above Travancore before&#8221;. The rest of the paragraph continues without any further elaboration or explanation. I&#8217;m assuming that they mean planes fly over here, but surely you could say that about pretty much any part of the city??
  * Lots of places losing points due to &#8220;buses&#8221;. This seems really arbitrary. And, as many on Twitter have already pointed out, it&#8217;s completely stupid to score each transport mode separately and not consider the **quality** of the transport. A much more sensible solution would be to have a single category each for public transport frequency, directness, service span, etc. You know, <a href="http://www.snamuts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like properly qualified transport experts actually do</a> &#8211; rather than a third-rate real estate advertising website teaming up with a private consultancy who think that this makes good urban design.
  * Alphington receiving the _seventh highest score for trains in all of Melbourne_. Seriously?? I barely know where to begin with this one. Leaving aside the fact that Alphington has just one ramshackle old station, it is only located on one line (the Hurstbridge Line) which only has trains every 20 minutes during most times and days of the week. Literally any suburb with more than one train line anywhere in Melbourne would beat Alphington for decent access to trains. Genius.
  * Cremorne has risen from 135th in 2017 to 20th in 2019. What on Earth has happened to merit this meteoric rise? I can&#8217;t see very much that has changed at all, other than a couple of heritage buildings being destroyed to build new shitbox apartmenets. It also has a crime problem. Apparently.
  * Fitzroy is apparently the fourth most dangerous suburb in Melbourne for crime. I have no idea what kind of metrics they are using to measure this, but clearly something is wrong with them.
  * The &#8220;score for buses&#8221; in South Melbourne is apparently in the top 10 for all of Melbourne?? &#8220;South Melbourne has one of the worst crime rates in the city&#8221;. REALLY??
  * Parkville gets a low education score despite having two universities, medical teaching facilities and a whole host of other education providers. Why? According to Domain, universities don&#8217;t count as education facilities: &#8220;universities were not measured in this study&#8221;. Wow.
  * Ok Alphington&#8217;s train score was stupid, but listing Ashburton as having excellent public transport is a new level of cosmic ignorance. Apparently this suburb located on the Alamein Line &#8220;scores most strongly&#8230;for trains&#8221;. Right. So having two stations on one of the <a href="https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/route/1/alamein/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most poorly-serviced lines in Melbourne</a> is terrific apparently.
  * Ivanhoe has high crime apparently.
  * All the emphasis on &#8220;congestion&#8221; and &#8220;congested roads&#8221; is misguided at best and plain idiotic at worst. Otherwise nice suburbs like Burnley and South Melbourne are given lower rankings for this reason. Well guess what? If you live right next to the CBD, your roads are probably going to have a lot of traffic on it. And in further breaking news, you&#8217;d be pretty stupid to try driving a car through there in the first place!
  * I&#8217;ll let this one speak for itself: &#8220;_After slipping to 126th place in the last study, Seddon is back to its previous top 50 spot, most likely due to the increased number of cafes in the area_&#8220;. Tells you everything you need to know about where Domain&#8217;s &#8220;reporters&#8221; come from.
  * Docklands has the third-highest score on &#8220;culture&#8221; in Melbourne. Let that sink in for a moment.
  * Deepdene has &#8220;the worst&#8221; congested roads in the city. Leaving aside the fact that it&#8217;s a tiny suburb, which roads?? It only has two major roads going through it (Whitehorse Road and Burke Road). Both can be pretty congested at times, but compared to, say, the West Gate Freeway or Dandenong Road, they&#8217;re quiet residential streets.
  * &#8220;Box Hillâ€™s ranking will improve with less crime&#8221;. Do they know something we don&#8217;t?
  * Ormond apparently has the highest ranking for trains in all of Melbourne. **ORMOND.**
  * Balwyn North has a &#8220;good tram network&#8221;. Domain apparently think that a single, <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/tram-squeeze-eases-but-some-still-suffer-20130619-2oj1i.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overcrowded</a> tram route constitutes a &#8220;network&#8221;. Try again.
  * Ripponlea scores lower because of a lack of hills. Yes, seriously.

Message to Domain.com.au &#8220;writers&#8221;: please go to planning school and try again. Or, better still, stick to your knitting and write endlessly about &#8220;affordable Melbourne suburbs under $1 million!!&#8221; in places like Melton South and Horsham.
