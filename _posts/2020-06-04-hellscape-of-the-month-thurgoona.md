If your first response to this post was &#8220;where the hell is Thurgoona?&#8221; then you&#8217;re on the right track.

This place has the foreboding description on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurgoona,_New_South_Wales" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> as &#8220;an outer suburb of the regional city of Albury&#8221; &#8211; which should be enough to send a chill down the spine of any planner.

Now this isn&#8217;t an attack on central Albury itself. It&#8217;s a perfectly respectable large country town with nice heritage buildings and perpetual <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wodonga" target="_blank">Multiple Personality Disorder.</a> Instead, this is a taste of subdivisions in regional Australia &#8211; almost all of which are about the quality of shower plug hair.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

_Trigger warning &#8211; developers attempting to use their brains._

Let&#8217;s begin on the very edge of this suburb.

It&#8217;s fantastic to see such great integration between different landholdings. Obviously each original owner sold their land to separate developers who saw absolutely no reason to build roads or footpaths that actually connect to each other. If you want to visit a friend who lives in the other estate, bad luck.

And props to the local council for letting this happen. Great structure planning everyone! Awards all round.

The other problem (obvious to a three year old but apparently not developers) is that there is only one shopping area for about a three kilometre radius. This, combined with the complete lack of public transport, bike lanes or footpaths, means that your only option is to drive a car.

I&#8217;m sure that will cause absolutely no problems whatsoever in a city plagued by <a href="https://www.bordermail.com.au/story/6432323/seven-in-10-border-residents-now-overweight-or-obese/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obesity and diabetes</a>.

Meanwhile, this developer a little further west decided that nobody would ever want to walk along the existing track through bushland. So instead they now have a splendid view of back fences with no way to get through.

And finally, as usual with these sorts of hellscapes, the biggest middle finger to Jane Jacobs comes in the form of a huge fuck-off golf course in the middle of the suburb.

<p><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m12!1m3!1d4685.294516347483!2d147.0016568296979!3d-36.0495248831298!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!5e1!3m2!1sen!2sau!4v1591265658399!5m2!1sen!2sau" allowfullscreen="" width="600" height="450"></iframe></p>

Never mind that this used to be useful bushland with a beautiful creek bubbling away happily. 

Instead, we decided to cut down all the trees to build a massive grass paddock filled with poisonous chemicals so that overweight retired bankers can hit tiny balls with sticks for their pathetic amusement.

It also means that getting anywhere between each housing estate is made even more difficult because nobody can get through the fenced area reserved for these &#8220;sports&#8221; activities.

I guess for a suburb where its residents think that some guy taking a photo of a lizard is worthy of inclusion on its <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurgoona,_New_South_Wales" target="_blank">Wikipedia entry</a>, we shouldn&#8217;t expect too much. Nor would I even care that much if it wasn&#8217;t for the fact that this shit occupies space that could be used for something far better (usually what was there before &#8211; farmland or bush).

Welcome to Thurgoona.
