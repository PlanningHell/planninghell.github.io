It has recently been brought to my attention that the designer of a subdivision in Brisbane received an Order of Australia in the Queens Birthday Honour&#8217;s List.

Intruiged to find what may be the first well-designed new suburb in Australia, I investigated further to save anyone else the pain.

Unfortunately what little optimism that I had left in me quickly evaporated. I&#8217;m sorry to report that Springfield is just as shit as any other outer suburban development in this country and is, in many ways, arguably worse.

So let&#8217;s have a look at this in more detail&#8230;

&#8220;Greater Springfield&#8221; (no idea what makes it &#8216;greater&#8217;) has won awards as recently as 2019 &#8211; this latest one being from the brains trust over at the Urban Development Institute of Australia (UDIA). Springfield won an award for being the &#8220;most significant and outstanding urban development project in Queensland over the past 25 years&#8221;. 25 YEARS!!

These self-congratulatory accolades from developers don&#8217;t just stop there. It&#8217;s won several other awards from the UDIA and a few others, which are listed on their website [here](https://www.greaterspringfield.com.au/us/urban-planning-awards/). My personal favourite is one from 2010 which bills it as the &#8220;world&#8217;s best master planned community&#8221; for that year. Move over Netherlands & Denmark &#8211; QUEENSLAND now has the best planning apparently!

Please keep all of this in mind as we explore this magical place. With such gushing reviews from fellow developers, you&#8217;d expect something quite special.

Let&#8217;s start with transport.

Rule 1 of urban planning that even undergraduates can tell you: **densify around transport hubs**. There are two train stations: Springfield and Springfield Central.

Springfield has nothing but typical suburban houses around it. The shops have been built an annoying 11 minute walk away and the community centre is almost a kilometre away in the opposite direction.

Springfield &#8220;Central&#8221; doesn&#8217;t even have this. It&#8217;s surrounded by nothing but carparking and trees. If, for some reason, you did want to walk to the station, [you can&#8217;t even cross on all legs of the nearest intersection](https://goo.gl/maps/jCvzosVJcCfNiM9t8).

<p><iframe style="border: 0;" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d1291.2185928729753!2d152.90229190728166!3d-27.674360364992374!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x6b914a3e78c647d7%3A0xf6af1d29ac7ef2e!2sSpringfield%20Central%20station!5e1!3m2!1sen!2sau!4v1583810323738!5m2!1sen!2sau" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

Let&#8217;s move on to walking and cycling.

Even for a Queensland suburb, this really does suck if you want to travel in anything but a car.

Take this as a random example to start with. In the main town centre, the developer has decided that putting several massive roundabouts without any facilities for pedestrians or cyclists was a great idea. Roundabouts are particularly bad for both of these transport modes as they make travelling much less safe. So this is the result that you get:

<p><iframe style="border: 0;" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m12!1m3!1d456.50400056480447!2d152.90482305135106!3d-27.67692355239485!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!5e1!3m2!1sen!2sau!4v1583810602491!5m2!1sen!2sau" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

Even if you do make it out of the town centre on foot without being killed at a roundabout, you can look forward to negotiating your street where many don&#8217;t have any footpaths. If you&#8217;re lucky, you might have a footpath on only one side.

This sort of anti-pedestrian nonsense might have been considered acceptable urban planning in the 1980s, but this developer appears to have never moved on into the 21st century. And it DEFINITELY doesn&#8217;t merit any award worthy of the name.

Someone also decided that uncontrolled pedestrian crossings at on-ramps with a design speed of 80km/h was a terrific idea, and they have done this almost everywhere.

Also, wtf is going on with the path here?

<p><iframe style="border: 0;" src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!4v1583811043979!6m8!1m7!1srWV7S_RX7YJ96uyrcnEZUw!2m2!1d-27.67320722070396!2d152.8982369829602!3f3.049198002793595!4f-14.99887465754179!5f0.7820865974627469" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

I could go on for a long time with these examples, but let&#8217;s move onto another aspect &#8211; zoning.

This &#8220;world&#8217;s best master planned community&#8221; is designed entirely around people driving their cars. You don&#8217;t even need to read the transport section above &#8211; just look at the land use planning.

The developer appears to have read one urban planning textbook about Garden Cities and then called it a day. The monotonous, single-use zoning is replicated right across this suburb. There are only a few large town centres scattered randomly around the place. As a result, their walking/biking catchments are much smaller than older (and better-planned) cities.

You can see this across all of these centres. To take one random example, this shopping centre in the northern part of the suburb has no safe crossing point to approach it from the south or west and absolutely no provision for bikes at all. There&#8217;s a huge multi-lane roundabout and moat of carparking to make things even worse. Even better, there isn&#8217;t a footpath from the bus stop into the centre directly. It just sends you down some stairs (great for wheelchair users or with mobility aids) and spits you out into a sea of asphalt.

I could go on for much longer about the other shit that&#8217;s been &#8220;planned&#8221; in Springfield, but I think we&#8217;ll leave it there for now. I may summon enough rage in the future to continue in more detail, but we&#8217;ll leave with this little list of things that I didn&#8217;t get to:

  * These <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Sj1r1BUbbF9wL8kW9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">idiotic (and sometimes misspelled) street names</a> in the town centres are triggering
  * The University is [over a kilometre away](https://goo.gl/maps/DMYuWZ5P7tYUZCeJ6) from the station
  * Slip lanes everywhere, including for [driveways](https://goo.gl/maps/uAhQMRiWPpAdQGFx6)
  * [Really great access betwen streets](https://goo.gl/maps/fx3WqGS8tMvQTBj58)

etc.

Again, this is by no means the worst development in Australia. There are many others that I could point to that are far more idiotic.

But the fact that this one won awards praising it like it&#8217;s the best thing since sliced cheese is ludicrous at best.

So the moral of the story seems to be: **never trust awards given out by developers**. Not only do they have a clear vested interest in selling <a href="https://theconversation.com/forget-heatwaves-our-cold-houses-are-much-more-likely-to-kill-us-83030" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">badly-insulated</a> and <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-07-16/flammable-cladding-removal-fund-victorian-government/11311518" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shoddily-built houses</a> to the unsuspecting public, but they also clearly have no idea what they&#8217;re talking about when it comes to urban planning and what actually makes a good suburb.

If you don&#8217;t believe and would like to see it for yourself, you can access Springfield at any time you happen to be in Brisbane. Just be prepared to drive a lot and bring your headache tablets.
