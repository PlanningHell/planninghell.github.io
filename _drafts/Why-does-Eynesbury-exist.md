If you've ever heard of this inky stain on the landscape of Victoria, well done. Your brain has been damaged already, purely by exposure to such a cesspool of bad planning and design.  
  
If not and your mind is unsullied by such filth, then read on to find out more.

Eynesbury is everything that good planning is not.

Built in the early 2000s using a loophole in planning laws that are meant to protect green space on the edges of Melbourne, this &#8220;township&#8221; is a cluster of 99.99% residential suburban hell in the middle of nowhere.

Not even the &#8220;free market&#8221; wants to touch this place with a bargepole. It says a lot when it has changed ownership &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eynesbury,_Victoria#Financial_issues" target="_blank">several times</a>&#8221; and its developers have spent a lot of time in Victoria&#8217;s court system.

## So what is it and why is it there?
Basically Eynesbury was built in a place where it shouldn't have. It's smack bang in the middle of a 'Green Wedge Zone'.

This zone was designated many years ago to try to protect the remaining green space around the edge of Melbourne from the endless sprawl of concrete and cul-de-sacs that brain-dead developers keep building in the suburbs. It's been constantly changed and "reviewed" by pretty much every government since then in a "death by a thousand cuts" scenario - but I think we'd best leave that for another time.

Anyway, you'd think that one thing that would be absolutely prohibited in these areas would be, you know, shitty sprawl of concrete and cul-de-sacs.

Under normal circumstances you would be right. Unfortunately because our planning system in Victoria is so cooked, the original developers managed to magically get approval from the State Government to use the zone **for the exact opposite purpose for which it was designated**.

The worst part of this story is that this wasn't just any old green wedge zone area. Eynesbury is/was home to a box tree forest, one of the most intact and largest remnants of this important habitat.

So what did the developers of Eynesbury decide to do with this forest? __Build a road through the middle.__

I'm not joking. I really wish I was.

In a sane world, such an environmentally significant and irreplaceable asset like this would be well-protected and kept well away from the grubby hands of developers whose IQ is only slightly above that of a brick wall.

According to them (having attended Greenwashing school) it's completely fine because they built a golf course and the houses have recycled water. Environmental sustainability!

## Textbook shit planning
But let's leave aside its environmental destruction for now before we get another migraine headache, and focus instead on how it performs on planning grounds.

Spoiler alert: not well.

Would you care to guess how many shops there are in Eynesbury? Five? Ten? Twenty?

One.

There is ONE shop in the entire "township".

And guess what kind of shop it is? A golf shop. Not a grocery store, supermarket or anything else that might actually be useful.

There are technically two if you count the cafe/restaurant next door, but it has hilariously bad opening hours ([it's only open for dinner one day a week](https://goo.gl/maps/HQQJ23sSqzsPu6QP8)) and doesn't actually sell any groceries.

Instead, you have to drive 12 kilometres to the nearest shops in Melton South.

And yes, you have to drive, because there is absolutely no public transport, cycling or walking access to Eynesbury.

How about employment opportunities?

Well there is absolutely nothing in Eynesbury (unless you work in the golf shop or "cafe") so you have to travel outside. And again, you have to drive your car because there are no other options.

Even better, if you have a job anywhere that isn't north, you're utterly screwed because there is no access to get west, east or south.

The worst part is that places like Tarneit and Werribee lie to the south of Eynesbury which have loads of jobs, schools and services. And yet you can't get to them without an extra 40 minute drive via Deer Park basically.
